# hello-world

Hello, this is first repository, new ideas will be stored here. 

I am currently a junior at UT studying CS and mathematics. I am interested in learning about data science and it's many applications. I am currently capable of working proficiently in c standard and python. I would like to learn R for machine learning and analytics. I love mathematics, mountain biking, music and tacos.
